                    <h2>Use of Time in Peru (2010-2024) and UK (2024)</h2>
                    <p>An in-depth analysis of time use patterns across this two countries and years, examining how people allocate their time to different activities and how this has changed over time. This is an important issue because the use of time is one of the latest problems that people are facing after the pandemic. The effects and changes from years before and now are relevant in terms of policy making and proposing new public interventions.</p>

                        <strong>There is a clear gender gap (Peru (+1.21 hrs) | UK (+0.94 hrs)):</strong> In the case of UK, the information find for 2024 reveals people use more their time for paid work and also for leisure. But in the case of Perú people invest more hours in care and houshold. And if we look into que difference between gender, women in Peru dedicat more time in activities related to taking care of family or using it to help others, while the men have more freedom to decide in what to invest that time (like leisure). This pattern is similar in the case of UK but the gap is not tight than in the case of Peru. Besides that, it is clear that UK's people can invest more time in unpaid activities that are vinculated with activities that helps into mental health (leisure time). The most important finding is that Peruvian women have 75% less leisure time than Peruvian men, compared to only 13% less in the UK.

                        <strong>Over 14 years (2010-2024), Peru experienced economic growth and social change, but gender inequalities in time allocation have PERSISTED—and in some cases WORSENED:</strong> There is a clear pattern about reducing the gap in the leasure time, but in the case of using time in houshold work, there is a minimal improvement. In 2010, women use orund 2.8 hours per day, and it past oonly to 2.55 in 2024. There is a similar change in the case of men (1.5 passed to 1.34) but the gap is persistent.
